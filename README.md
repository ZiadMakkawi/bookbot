# BookBot

BookBot is a small CLI project (from Boot.dev) that analyzes plain-text books.  
It reports total word count and character frequency (sorted descending).

## Description
This tool reads a text file and prints:
- total number of words
- character frequency counts (letters aâ€“z, lowercase), sorted by frequency

It is intended as a simple practice project to reinforce Python file I/O, string processing, and basic CLI handling.

## Quick start


**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+

**Run**
```bash
python3 main.py path/to/book.txt
```
P.S if you want you can add more books to the "books" directory
